### 2. üè∑Ô∏è Optimized Hashtag Suggestions

One of the biggest challenges content creators face is choosing relevant hashtags to expand their post‚Äôs reach. In this project, the AI automatically analyzes the generated microblog, identifies key themes, and suggests 5‚Äì7 optimized hashtags to boost engagement.

The algorithm mixes popular hashtags‚Äîwith high reach‚Äîwith niche ones that help target segmented audiences. All hashtags are pre-formatted with the `#` symbol and ready to copy and use on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Instagram.

**How does it work in practice?**
Each time you generate a microblog, hashtags appear separately, making it easy to pick and copy them all at once.

### 3. üí° Strategic Insights

Beyond text generation, the app also provides practical tips to improve your social media presence. For each microblog, the AI analyzes engagement potential and suggests:

* Best times to publish (based on general trends)
* Tips to expand reach
* Strategies to boost follower engagement
* Trends related to your topic

These insights appear with the generated content, helping you post **better**, at the right time, and with a higher chance of going viral.

### 4. üìã Copy-to-Clipboard System

User experience is a priority. That‚Äôs why you can quickly copy just the microblog text, just the hashtags, or both (text + hashtags) with a single click. A visual feedback appears confirming the content is ready to paste on any social network, email, or document.

The system is fully compatible with modern browsers and social platforms, making it fast, easy, and error-free to share your microblog.

### 5. üõ°Ô∏è Rate Limiting and Validation

To keep the service fast and stable for everyone, the backend limits each user to 10 microblog generations per minute. If that limit is exceeded, a friendly error message appears, advising to wait before trying again.

Also, all form fields are validated in real time. You‚Äôll be notified immediately if you miss a required field or exceed the character limit, helping prevent frustration. These measures also protect against spam and abuse.

### 6. üé® Responsive Interface

The interface is designed to work perfectly on both desktop and mobile. The mobile-first design ensures that all buttons, forms, and content areas are easy to use on any screen size.

Smooth animations enhance the experience, adding a sense of modernity and professionalism.

Lastly, the app follows accessibility best practices, with ARIA labels and proper semantic structure‚Äîmaking it usable for people with screen readers or other specific needs.$
